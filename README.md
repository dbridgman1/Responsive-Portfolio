# Responsive-Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a web application that is responsive on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.  When creating any web application it needs to be designed with a mobile-first mindset.  Many clients require this feature because so many users are using their phones over their desktops.  This particular application with constructed with personalized information (bio, name, etc.).  


## Developer 

I received instructions to create a responsive web application using bootstrap as my main vehicle to acheive that.  This is my first project really diving into bootstrap and it was certainly challening.  Its much different than using a CSS document to style a web page.  I had some growing pains while using this langauage and the many different types of classes definitely gave me the biggest headache.  I am looking forward to getting more practice with this language in the future.  I think its a great and convienent way of styling a webpage and I can certainly see why it is so popluar.
